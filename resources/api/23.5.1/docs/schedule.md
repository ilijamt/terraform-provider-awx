# List Schedules:

Make a GET request to this resource to retrieve the list of
schedules.

The resulting data structure contains:

    {
        "count": 99,
        "next": null,
        "previous": null,
        "results": [
            ...
        ]
    }

The `count` field indicates the total number of schedules
found for the given query.  The `next` and `previous` fields provides links to
additional results if there are more than will fit on a single page.  The
`results` list contains zero or more schedule records.  

## Results

Each schedule data structure includes the following fields:

* `rrule`: A value representing the schedules iCal recurrence rule. (string)
* `id`: Database ID for this schedule. (integer)
* `type`: Data type for this schedule. (choice)

    - `None`: ---------
    - `""`: ---------
    - `run`: Run
    - `check`: Check
* `job_tags`:  (string)
* `skip_tags`:  (string)
* `limit`:  (string)
* `diff_mode`:  (boolean)
* `verbosity`:  (choice)
    - `None`: ---------
    - `0`: 0 (Normal)
    - `1`: 1 (Verbose)
    - `2`: 2 (More Verbose)
    - `3`: 3 (Debug)
    - `4`: 4 (Connection Debug)
    - `5`: 5 (WinRM Debug)
* `execution_environment`: The container image to be used for execution. (id)

* `unified_job_template`:  (id)
* `enabled`: Enables processing of this schedule. (boolean)
* `dtstart`: The first occurrence of the schedule occurs on or after this time. (datetime)
* `dtend`: The last occurrence of the schedule occurs before this time, aftewards the schedule expires. (datetime)
* `next_run`: The next time that the scheduled action will run. (datetime)
* `timezone`: The timezone this schedule runs in. This field is extracted from the RRULE. If the timezone in the RRULE is a link to another timezone, the link will be reflected in this field. (field)
* `until`: The date this schedule will end. This field is computed from the RRULE. If the schedule does not end an empty string will be returned (field)



## Sorting

To specify that schedules are returned in a particular
order, use the `order_by` query string parameter on the GET request.

    ?order_by=name

Prefix the field name with a dash `-` to sort in reverse:

    ?order_by=-name

Multiple sorting fields may be specified by separating the field names with a
comma `,`:

    ?order_by=name,some_other_field

## Pagination

Use the `page_size` query string parameter to change the number of results
returned for each request.  Use the `page` query string parameter to retrieve
a particular page of results.

    ?page_size=100&page=2

The `previous` and `next` links returned with the results will set these query
string parameters automatically.

## Searching

Use the `search` query string parameter to perform a case-insensitive search
within all designated text fields of a model.

    ?search=findme

(_Added in Ansible Tower 3.1.0_) Search across related fields:

    ?related__search=findme

Note: If you want to provide more than one search term, multiple
search fields with the same key, like `?related__search=foo&related__search=bar`,
will be ORed together. Terms separated by commas, like `?related__search=foo,bar`
will be ANDed together.

## Filtering

Any additional query string parameters may be used to filter the list of
results returned to those matching a given value.  Only fields and relations
that exist in the database may be used for filtering.  Any special characters
in the specified value should be url-encoded. For example:

    ?field=value%20xyz

Fields may also span relations, only for fields and relationships defined in
the database:

    ?other__field=value

To exclude results matching certain criteria, prefix the field parameter with
`not__`:

    ?not__field=value

By default, all query string filters are AND'ed together, so
only the results matching *all* filters will be returned.  To combine results
matching *any* one of multiple criteria, prefix each query string parameter
with `or__`:

    ?or__field=value&or__field=othervalue
    ?or__not__field=value&or__field=othervalue

(_Added in Ansible Tower 1.4.5_) The default AND filtering applies all filters
simultaneously to each related object being filtered across database
relationships.  The chain filter instead applies filters separately for each
related object. To use, prefix the query string parameter with `chain__`:

    ?chain__related__field=value&chain__related__field2=othervalue
    ?chain__not__related__field=value&chain__related__field2=othervalue

If the first query above were written as
`?related__field=value&related__field2=othervalue`, it would return only the
primary objects where the *same* related object satisfied both conditions.  As
written using the chain filter, it would return the intersection of primary
objects matching each condition.

Field lookups may also be used for more advanced queries, by appending the
lookup to the field name:

    ?field__lookup=value

The following field lookups are supported:

* `exact`: Exact match (default lookup if not specified).
* `iexact`: Case-insensitive version of `exact`.
* `contains`: Field contains value.
* `icontains`: Case-insensitive version of `contains`.
* `startswith`: Field starts with value.
* `istartswith`: Case-insensitive version of `startswith`.
* `endswith`: Field ends with value.
* `iendswith`: Case-insensitive version of `endswith`.
* `regex`: Field matches the given regular expression.
* `iregex`: Case-insensitive version of `regex`.
* `gt`: Greater than comparison.
* `gte`: Greater than or equal to comparison.
* `lt`: Less than comparison.
* `lte`: Less than or equal to comparison.
* `isnull`: Check whether the given field or related object is null; expects a
  boolean value.
* `in`: Check whether the given field's value is present in the list provided;
  expects a list of items.

Boolean values may be specified as `True` or `1` for true, `False` or `0` for
false (both case-insensitive).

Null values may be specified as `None` or `Null` (both case-insensitive),
though it is preferred to use the `isnull` lookup to explicitly check for null
values.

Lists (for the `in` lookup) may be specified as a comma-separated list of
values.

(_Added in Ansible Tower 3.1.0_) Filtering based on the requesting user's
level of access by query string parameter.

* `role_level`: Level of role to filter on, such as `admin_role`

* DTSTART is expected to be in UTC
* INTERVAL is required
* SECONDLY is not supported
* RRULE must precede the rule statements
* BYDAY is supported but not BYDAY with a numerical prefix
* BYYEARDAY and BYWEEKNO are not supported
