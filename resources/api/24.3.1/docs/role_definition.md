Role Definitions (roles) contain a list of permissions and can be used to
assign those permissions to a user or team through the respective
assignment endpoints.

Custom roles can be created, modified, and deleted through this endpoint.
System-managed roles are shown here, which cannot be edited or deleted,
but can be assigned to users.
